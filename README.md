# Logistic Regression - DMV Written Tests

This project was performed as part of the course [*Logistic Regression with NumPy and Python*](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/JFYMHKYCLET8) on Coursera.

This model plots the scores of DMV Written Tests in the form of a scatter plot, defines a logistic sigmoid function, computes the cost function, implements gradient descent, plots the decision boundary, predicts the same for new values.
